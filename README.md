# About-Me
I am hoping to use this gitHub account more in my new course Métodos Numéricos taught by Johel Batista (Un crack)
- My objective is to learn more about the usage of gitHub in order to really exploit it to build new and exciting projects.
- Another objective would be to be more proficient in Python, so I can use it later for personal projects.

- Last but not least, it is important to have fun doing this, it's one of the courses I am interested in, and I know it will give its rewards if well learned.
